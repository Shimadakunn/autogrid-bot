# Automatic Grid Trading Bot

## Performances
I wrote in pine script a trading bot that has the ability to pass prop firms challenges. 

Here is a screen of a performance among many others of my trading bot on a 10k account. it has reached the profit target **within 2 days and less than 25 trades** .

## The Bot
For obvious reasons, I can not show the code but I will simply explain how it works.

You define a range in which you think the price will bounce and the bot will automatically take positions: long when the price reaches the bottom of the range and short when reaches top.

As you can imagine, taking a position is not that simple but it is the main principle.
